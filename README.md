## Why did you start this project?
I had nothing to do, and school is driving me insane.

### What does it do?
It personally assists you.

### Does it recognize your voice?
Not yet. (And it will never)

### Does it have a GUI?
Not yet. (And it will never)

### Can it talk via text-to-speech?
Not yet. (And it will never)

# To-Do list (These things will never happen as I abandoned the project)

+ get the text-to-speech working
+ get voice recognition working
+ add commands
+ too much to add to the list...
